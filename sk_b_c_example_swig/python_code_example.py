Just going to leave a reminder here:
    If you use the same name for your 
    python script as a python library
    (especially one that you call IN 
    that script), you're gonna have a
    bad time.

square3 = square(3)
square11 = square(11)

print("2 squared is", square2)
print("3 squared is", square3)
